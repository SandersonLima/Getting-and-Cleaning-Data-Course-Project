# Getting and Cleaning  Data  
# ------ Course Project ------

This repo contains the required scripts on the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

# The R script does the following:
* ` Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.`
* ` Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.`
* ` Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set`
* ` Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.`
* ` From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.`

Then, the final result is shown in the file `Tidy_Data.txt`.


## PS. This repo also contains a file that is the Code Book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set (summarization of data variables) and an explaination of the code to process (tidy) the data.
